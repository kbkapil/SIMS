## Steps to Complete
- [x] Check MySQL service status and database existence

- [x] Monitor startup logs for errors or warnings
- [x] Test home page (http://localhost:8080/)
- [x] Test login page (http://localhost:8080/login)
- [x] Test user dashboard (http://localhost:8080/user/dashboard) - Redirects to login (expected if not logged in)
- [x] Test admin dashboard (http://localhost:8080/admin/dashboard) - Redirects to login (expected if not logged in)
- [x] Test bookings page (http://localhost:8080/bookings) - Redirects to login (expected if not logged in)
- [x] Test new booking page (http://localhost:8080/new-booking) - Redirects to login (expected if not logged in)
